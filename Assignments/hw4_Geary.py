# Create file variable and open Alice (Alice.txt) in Wonderland 

 

 

 

# Create file variable and open WordCount.txt for writing

#  wordcount = open("AliceWordCount.txt", 'w')

 

 

 

# Read contents of Alice.txt into a string variable

 

 

 

# Create a list from the string variable and covert all text to lower-case

 

 

 

# Create a dictionary variable -- note your dictionary will have 'words' as    #  keys and an integer as a value (which will be the number of words seen in #  the file)

 

 

 

# loop through each word in your list and

#   1) if it is not in the dictionary, add it with the key pair = 1

#   2) if already in the dictionary, increment key pair by 1

 

 

 

# Now, Loop througth each word and write it to your output file in the format #  specified Note that your dictionary contains some non alphabetic 'words

#  before writing to the file, check first if it is a legitimate word.  

#  Hint: use isalpha()

 

 

 

# Close both the input and output files
